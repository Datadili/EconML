    "Consider a typical neural network setup, where each layer's output, $ h^l $, is computed using a weight matrix $ W^l $, a bias $ b^l $, and an activation function $ f^l $. \n",

    "where $ f^l $ is the activation function applied element-wise.\n",

    "we can use the chain rule:\n",

    "1. Start by noting the function composition in $ h^l $:\n",
    "   $$ h^l = f^l(z^l) $$\n",
    "   where $ z^l = W^l h^{l-1} + b^l $.\n",

    "Early stopping helps avoid overfitting when training a machine learning model, particularly with iterative methods like stochastic gradient descent. The concept involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping the training process if the performance on the validation set ceases to improve or begins to degrade, despite continued improvements on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping effectively adds a regularization effect without the need for explicit regularization techniques like $ L^1 $ or $ L^2 $ penalties. It prevents the model from learning noise and complex patterns in the training data that do not generalize to new data, which is essentially what overfitting is. It can also reduce computational costs by stopping training before all allocated resources (like epochs) are used, especially if no further learning improvement is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "While helpful, calling it a \"free lunch\" should be taken with caution. It doesnât avoid the need to deal with needing to tune of the patience parameter and set up the validation process to avoid premature stopping or too late stopping, which can still lead to underfitting or overfitting, respectively. Moreover, it relies heavily on having a well-separated validation set that accurately represents unseen data, which isn't always available or easy to construct, especially in cases with limited data.\n"

    "Normalization is highly recommended, primarily because it helps in speeding up the training process and achieving better convergence. Here are the main reasons for normalizing data when training neural networks. Neural networks often perform better when input features are on a similar scale. This uniformity prevents certain features from disproportionately influencing the model's learning, which is particularly important for weights to converge more quickly during gradient descent. Moreover, when data are not normalized, the gradients during training can become very small (vanish) or very large (explode), especially in deep networks. This can lead to unstable training processes, where the network either learns too slowly or diverges. Relatedly, normalization ensures that the error surface is more spherical. Without normalization, the surface can be elongated, meaning gradient descent takes longer paths towards minima, potentially oscillating inefficiently down steep slopes.\n",

    "The decision on whether to penalize weights, biases, or both in a neural network generally hinges on the goals of regularization and the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Penalizing Weights**: \n",
    "   - Regularization techniques like $L^2$ (Ridge) and $L^1$ (Lasso) are typically applied to weights. Penalizing weights helps in controlling the model's complexity by keeping the weights small, which encourages the model to find simpler patterns that may generalize better on unseen data.\n",
    "   - By keeping weights small, it reduces the risk of the model fitting too closely to the noise in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Penalizing Biases**:\n",
    "   - It is generally less common to penalize biases because they do not control the complexity of the model in the same way that weights do. Biases are meant to provide flexibility to the model by allowing shifts to the decision boundary.\n",
    "   - Penalizing biases can lead to underfitting since it restricts the model's ability to fit even the correct general trend of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's usually best to penalize just the weights because this directly addresses the model's complexity without unduly limiting its capacity to fit the data appropriately. Since biases help in fitting the model more flexibly to the data without significantly increasing the complexity, they are typically left unpenalized to maintain the model's adaptive performance across varying data dynamics.\n"

    "Adding 50% more data to an existing dataset and retraining the model inherently changes the dynamics of how the model interacts with the data. If you randomly split the combined dataset into training, validation, and test sets, the key to ensuring that the test error estimate is unbiased relies on the independence of the test set. If the test data contains examples that are not representative of the overall dataset or are similar to the training set, the test error might not accurately reflect how the model will perform on truly unseen data. Moreover, there's a risk of data leakage if the test set includes data that's too similar to or influenced by the training data. This could happen if the new data shares specific characteristics or patterns with the old data that the model has already learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the test error estimate remains unbiased, we could consider splitting the data based on time (if it's time-series data) or some logical separation that ensures the test set is likely to encounter scenarios the model hasn't explicitly trained on. This helps mimic real-world application where future data or different scenarios are encountered. If the dataset has classes or categories, use stratified sampling to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets each contain a representative mix of all classes. This prevents class imbalance in any of the sets, which could bias the model's performance and thus the error estimate. From the combined dataset, allocate a portion as a hold-out test set before training begins. This set should not be used in any way during the model training or tuning processes, including not influencing the selection of $ \\lambda $. It serves as a final evaluator to test the model's performance. Finally, we would want to consider using k-fold cross-validation, especially if data is limited, to ensure that every data point gets used for both training and testing. This helps in understanding the model's stability and robustness across different subsets of data.\n"
